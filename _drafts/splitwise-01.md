Some of my favourite things to do: getting beers with my friends, going hiking, making dinner for as many people as we can cram in the living room. Road trips, in the summer to the mountains and in the winter to visit friends in other cities. The financials get hazy; someone drives and buys all the gas, you cover groceries, someone pays for the gear rental and then it starts getting hard to tell who owes who how much.

Historically speaking there's an astonishingly [diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) set of ways to handle these kinds of situations, but in my circles a lot of people use something like Splitwise or Tricount. I've been shopping toy project ideas and I've settled on trying to build one of these settling-up calculators for a bit of Python practice.
