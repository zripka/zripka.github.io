<sup>1</sup> The number is off by five compared to the total income dataset (see [here]({% post_url 2023-06-26-canada-income %})). I took the sum of all the values, excluding the $100,000 and over category, and it turns out that number is also off by a few households. I am not sure what explains that discrepancy, minor as it is.
