# Mapping COVID-19 in Montreal
I made these two maps in spring 2021 for the Trottier Family Foundation. The purpose of the maps was to inform policy discussions, especially the placement of vaccine sites and vaccine equity.

This map shows, at the neighbourhood level, the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100 000 people for the 4-week period leading up to May 10th, 2021.

This map shows the percentage fully vaccinated residents, current to May 16th, 2021. The geographic unit is smaller than a neighbourhood, called the "territoire de voisinage de residence" and defined by Montreal public health (DRSP). It translates roughly to "neighbourhood residence zone."

# COVID-19 and poverty
Without a doubt, the risk of contracting COVID-19 throughout the pandemic is [associated](https://nancyrossresearchgroup.ca/2020/07/03/updated-scatterplots-highlight-link-between-income-and-covid-19-in-north-american-cities/) with poverty. When I was a research assistant in the [Geo-social Determinants of Health Research Group](https://nancyrossresearchgroup.ca/) at McGill University, my colleagues and I worked to effectively [visualize](https://nancyrossresearchgroup.ca/2020/11/16/new-interactive-map-shows-relationship-between-income-and-covid-19-in-montreal/) the relationship between income and infection rates.

The darker the blue colour, the higher the neighbourhood's median income. The darker the red colour, the higher the COVID-19 infection rate. Dragging the toggle back and forth allows for easy comparison of the two variables, and shows a clear relationship: dark blue neighbourhoods tend to be light red, and vice versa, visually revealing the inverse relationship between income and COVID-19 infection rates.
